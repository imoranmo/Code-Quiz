# Code-Quiz
## Overview
For this assignment we were tasked to create a timed quiz. In my quiz I created a single html page with 3 blocks which contained the start, question, and endportion of the quiz. In my quiz once a respondent hits start they are automatically taken to the first question and the timer starts. As the respondent answers questions the response button turns either green or red depending on the correct answer. If the respondent selects a wrong answer their time is reduced by 10 seconds as well. Once the respondent answers all questions or takes over 60 seconds to complete they are taken to the final page. There they are able to submit their initials and see high scores as well.
